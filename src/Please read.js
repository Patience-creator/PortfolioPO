// Hi Benedikt

// Summary of my work in progress
// I'm still having trouble with the image and the overall responsiveness of the portfolio. 
// I am almost done but it's just this main things that I'm struggling with like i need to 
// find hook for the picture other than that I will keep the portfolio very minimal.
// I will show off my work on the second page I thought long about it and I don't want a about me section
// the cards on the second page are not totally done I will add buttoms to them
//  I had added a arrow below the picture and on the sides but i don't like how it looks like.
// I took them off and I will put a touch gesture animation I think that will look better.
// That's it for now, thankyou for reading this
